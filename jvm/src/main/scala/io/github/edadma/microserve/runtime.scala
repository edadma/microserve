/** JVM runtime. Auto-starts a daemon thread that drives the [[EventLoop]], so
  * the loop is "always on" the moment a [[JvmRuntime]] exists — matching
  * Node's and libuv's behaviour on the other two platforms. The loop is kept
  * alive by a phantom ref taken in the constructor; calling [[run]] drops
  * that ref and waits for the daemon to finish (i.e. for refCount to drop to
  * zero, which happens when the last server has closed and the last connection
  * has drained).
  *
  * Why a daemon: tests that use `AsyncFreeSpec` return a `Future[Assertion]`
  * to ScalaTest immediately — there's no spot to call `run()` synchronously.
  * Without a background driver, all work scheduled on `executionContext`
  * (Future continuations, accept handlers, …) would queue and never fire.
  *
  * Thread safety: the [[EventLoop]] uses a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` for the
  * microtask/immediate queues and an `AtomicInteger` for the ref-count, so
  * cross-thread `nextTick`, `unref`, and `executionContext.execute` are all
  * safe. `setTimeout`/`setInterval` defer the actual `PriorityQueue` mutation
  * onto the loop thread via the microtask queue, so they are also safe to
  * call from any thread (test code, user-thread setup) without corrupting
  * the heap. The deadline is stamped at the call site so the wait is measured
  * from the caller's clock, not from when the loop drains the microtask.
